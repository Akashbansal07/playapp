Hostlink: https://playapp-eight.vercel.app
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


Note: The video file is not accessible via Github repository, so I am attaching a screen recording of my website as Playapp.mov

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
